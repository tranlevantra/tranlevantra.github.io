    "text": "Before We Start\nThis article is aimed at those with some background in Machine Learning as it assumes the reader is familiar with the concepts of binary classification, model training, and evaluation metrics. Some refreshment is provided below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuick Refresher: Model Performance Assessment in Binary Classification Tasks\n\n\n\n\n\nBinary classification is a supervised learning task where the goal is to classify observations into one of two classes (0 or 1). For instance, in a medical diagnosis task, the model is trained to predict whether a patient has a disease (1) or not (0).\nThere are two types of training algorithms for binary classification:\n\nProbability based algorithms (logistic regression, support vector machines with a sigmoid kernel, neural networks with a sigmoid activation function, etc.) which output probability - a value between 0 and 1 indicating the likelihood of an observation belonging to the positive class (1)\nAnd Decision based algorithms (tree-based algorithms, etc.) which output a class label directly.\n\nIn reality, probability outputs are preferred because they provide more information about the uncertainty of the prediction. Nevertheless, decision based algorithms can output probabilities by using calibration methods when required.\nAfter training, the model is evaluated on a test dataset to assess its performance. The evaluation process typically involves converting the predicted probabilities into class labels using a decision threshold, and then calculating various performance metrics based on the confusion matrix.\nIn details,\nDecision Threshold: is a value between 0 and 1 such that if the probability output is greater than or equal to the decision threshold, the observation is classified as the positive class (1); otherwise, it is classified as the negative class (0).\nConfusion matrix: is obtained by comparing the predicted class labels from the model with the actual class labels (0 or 1) in the test dataset. It shows the counts of:\n\nTrue Positive (TP): The number of positive (1) instances correctly predicted as positive (1).\nTrue Negative (TN): The number of negative (0) instances correctly predicted as negative (0).\nFalse Positive (FP): The number of negative (0) instances incorrectly predicted as positive (1).\nFalse Negative (FN): The number of positive (1) instances incorrectly predicted as negative (0)."

    "text": "Unpopular Opinions on Binary Classification Assessment\n\nCalibration is an often-neglected aspect when assessing the performance of classification models\nAccuracy is just one of many evaluation metrics — a high accuracy alone doesn’t guarantee good real-world performance, especially in imbalanced datasets.\nWhile ROC curves are helpful for sensitivity analysis and threshold selection, interpreting them isn’t always straightforward, particularly when misclassification costs are unequal.\n\n\nCalibration metrics\nCalibration metrics in classification tasks evaluate how close the model’s predicted probabilities are to the true class labels (0 or 1), indicating the model’s reliability in estimating probabilities.\nFor example, in healthcare applications, a well-calibrated model would assign probabilities that closely reflect the true likelihood of disease presence or absence.\nSome of the most common calibration metrics are:\n\nThe mean squared difference between predicted probabilities and actual class labels.\n\\[\n\\text{Brier Score} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (P_i - o_i)^2\n\\]\nThe negative log-likelihood of the predicted probabilities given the actual class labels.\n\\[\n\\text{Log Loss} = -\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\left[ o_i \\log(P_i) + (1 - o_i) \\log(1 - P_i) \\right]\n\\]\nThe root mean squared difference between predicted probabilities and actual class labels.\n\\[\n\\text{RMS Calibration Error} = \\sqrt{ \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (P_i - o_i)^2 }\n\\]\n\nWhile the above metrics are useful for evaluating a model’s overall calibration, they don’t reveal how the model performs on each class individually. That’s why visualising predicted probabilities against actual class labels — as done in a reliability diagram (example in Figure 1 below)— is essential for uncovering insights that metrics alone might miss.\n\n\n\nFigure 1. The negative class (0) shows good calibration, with predicted probabilities tightly clustered around the actual class label. In contrast, the positive class (1) shows poorer calibration, with greater variability.\n\n\n\n\nAccuracy Metrics\nThese metrics are calculated after converting predicted probabilities to class labels (0 or 1) using the decision threshold.\n\nAccuracy: \\(\\frac{TP + TN}{TP + TN + FP + FN}\\)\nSensitivity (True Positive Rate, Recall): \\(\\frac{TP}{TP + FN}\\)\nSpecificity (True Negative Rate): \\(\\frac{TN}{TN + FP}\\)\nPrecision (Positive Predictive Value): \\(\\frac{TP}{TP + FP}\\)\nFalse Positive Rate (FPR): \\(\\frac{FP}{FP + TN}\\)\nF1 Score: \\(2 \\cdot \\frac{\\text{Precision} \\cdot \\text{Recall}}{\\text{Precision} + \\text{Recall}}\\)\nBalanced Accuracy: \\(\\frac{\\text{Sensitivity} + \\text{Specificity}}{2}\\)\nAnd many more …\n\nThese metrics give a fuller picture than accuracy alone, especially in imbalanced datasets where the number of instances in one class outweighs the other.\nFor example, in a breast cancer classification dataset where 90% of the instances are cancer-free (class 0) and only 10% have cancer (class 1), a model that predicts everyone to be cancer-free would still achieve 90% accuracy. However, such a model would be useless, as it fails to identify any actual cancer cases.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: An example of model performance on test data at the commonly used threshold of 0.5. The model achieves 90% accuracy but fails to detect the single positive case.\n\n\n\n\nSensitivity analysis\nROC Curve plots the true positive rate (sensitivity) against the false positive rate (1 - specificity) at various thresholds to reveal how sensitive the model is to changes in the decision threshold for each class.\n\n\n\nFigure 3: This ROC curve suggests the model performs poorly across most thresholds. It only identifies positives at very low thresholds, with a high false positive rate. Overall, the model struggles to separate the classes effectively\n\n\nThe optimal decision threshold is often chosen near the top-left corner of the ROC curve, where sensitivity and specificity are balanced. However, this assumes equal costs for false positives and false negatives — which is rarely the case.\nIn breast cancer screening, for example, missing a cancer case (false negative) is more serious than flagging a healthy person (false positive). In such cases, the threshold is lowered to prioritize detecting positives, making ROC interpretation less straightforward.\nFigure 4 shows the same model as in Figure 3, with reliability diagram and a confusion matrix that updates with the threshold — making it easier to see how model’s performance changes.\n\n\n\nFigure 4: From the reliability diagram, varying the threshold dynamically reveals how lowering it reduce false negatives while increase false positives. The confusion matrix further highlights how sensitive the two classes are to changes in threshold"

    "text": "Analysis\n\nAs the pandemic exposed the risks of outsourcing, more in-house fulfillment centers are being built. Major supermarket chains such as Coles, Woolworths, and MetCash-IGA only began developing their own distribution centers after COVID-19. Coles, for instance, relied on Linfox as its 3PL provider in 2018 but is now constructing its first in-house, fully automated facility in Melbourne. Among established names, only Aldi had its own center as early as 2010—its market-leading position highlights the benefits of taking full control over the supply chain.\nDespite the e-commerce boom, the 3PL market remains heavily dominated by Amazon, which continues to expand with mega fulfillment centers.\nFully automated fulfillment centers are becoming the norm, with new warehouses built by large, well-capitalized players like Amazon and Coles. These technologies are often out of reach for smaller operators, raising market barriers for new entrants.\nAltona, Laverton North, and Truganina remain key warehousing hubs, supported by prime location and ample land reserves for ongoing industrial development.",

Using floor() ensures we only create whole dots and do not overcount the population.\n\n3\n\nPopulation density dots are generated by sampling points within each SA1 polygon using the st_sample() function from sf package (see the function reference). To reduce computation time, we first remove SA1 blocks with zero population using filter(n_dots &gt; 0), since there’s no need to generate dots for empty areas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nSA1_count_shapefile |&gt;\n  mutate(n_dots = floor(Person / 100))  |&gt; \n  filter(n_dots &gt; 0)\n\n\nSimple feature collection with 14987 features and 3 fields (with 1 geometry empty)\nGeometry type: MULTIPOLYGON\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: 140.9619 ymin: -38.90962 xmax: 149.9762 ymax: -33.98064\nGeodetic CRS:  GCS_GDA2020\n# A tibble: 14,987 × 4\n   SA1_COD     Person                                            geometry n_dots\n * &lt;chr&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt;                                  &lt;MULTIPOLYGON [°]&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 20101100101    437 (((143.8009 -37.55382, 143.8004 -37.55376, 143.800…      4\n 2 20101100102    183 (((143.7977 -37.55071, 143.7978 -37.55075, 143.798…      1\n 3 20101100105    382 (((143.8156 -37.5587, 143.8169 -37.55885, 143.8175…      3\n 4 20101100106    584 (((143.801 -37.55383, 143.8024 -37.55399, 143.8032…      5\n 5 20101100107    363 (((143.8129 -37.55643, 143.813 -37.5561, 143.8132 …      3\n 6 20101100108    792 (((143.8089 -37.55476, 143.809 -37.55478, 143.8102…      7\n 7 20101100109    528 (((143.8044 -37.55316, 143.8046 -37.55213, 143.804…      5\n 8 20101100110    512 (((143.7886 -37.54654, 143.7882 -37.54637, 143.786…      5\n 9 20101100111    371 (((143.7923 -37.54826, 143.7922 -37.54849, 143.792…      3\n10 20101100112    424 (((143.7918 -37.5514, 143.7917 -37.55106, 143.7916…      4\n# ℹ 14,977 more rows\n\n\n\n… while its output should look like this:\n\n\n\nCode\npoints_sf\n\n\nSimple feature collection with 57470 features and 1 field\nGeometry type: POINT\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: 141.0321 ymin: -38.87474 xmax: 149.7605 ymax: -34.12203\nGeodetic CRS:  GCS_GDA2020\n# A tibble: 57,470 × 2\n     FID             geometry\n   &lt;dbl&gt;          &lt;POINT [°]&gt;\n 1     0  (143.802 -37.55391)\n 2     1  (143.804 -37.55111)\n 3     2 (143.8023 -37.54956)\n 4     3 (143.8039 -37.55215)\n 5     4 (143.7962 -37.55324)\n 6     5 (143.8123 -37.56792)\n 7     6 (143.8129 -37.56038)\n 8     7 (143.8142 -37.56515)\n 9     8 (143.8009 -37.55428)\n10     9 (143.7993 -37.55614)\n# ℹ 57,460 more rows\n\n\n\n… and demo on plotting the dots using ggplot2:\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot() +\n  geom_sf(data = SA1_count_shapefile, fill = \"grey95\", color = \"white\", size = 0.1) +\n  geom_sf(data = points_sf, color = \"orange\", size = 0.3, alpha = 0.7) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Population Density in Victoria\",\n    subtitle = \"Each dot represents ~100 people\",\n    caption = \"Source: ABS Census Data\",\n    fill = \"Population\"\n  ) +\n  theme(\n    legend.position = \"none\",\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\", hjust = 0.5),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 12, hjust = 0.5),\n    plot.caption = element_text(size = 8, hjust = 1)\n  )",

If you are completely new, I recommend resources from RLadies Sydney (BasicBasics and CleanItUp units are must-read).\nIn R, Working with tabular data using dplyr package is straightforward, |&gt;or%&gt;% pipe operators and these functions: mutate, select, filter and group_by along with 4 types of join should get you far.\nThe most popular package to work with spatial data in R is sf. An sf object extends regular tabular data frames to include a geometry column, which contains the spatial information. Thus, a simple explanation on how to read shapefiles with sf should be enough to get you started. Then, those mentioned dplyr functions will come in handy.\n\n\n\n\n1. Preparing data\nThis stage involves:\n\nRetrieving population data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS): ABS provides population counts at the smallest level - Mesh Block, along with allocation file for mapping among levels, and shapefiles for each level. By joining these files2, a shapefile with population counts of any level can be created.\nChoosing a resolution for the population dots (e.g., 1 dot = 100 people)\n\n\n1SA1_count_shapefile |&gt;\n2  dplyr::mutate(n_dots = floor(Person / 100))  |&gt;\n3  dplyr::filter(n_dots &gt; 0) -&gt; SA_count_shapefile\n\n\n1\n\nSA1_count_shapefile includes population counts Person, and polygon Geometry for each SA1 block (see below).\n\n2\n\nn_dots is the number of population dots to generate per SA1 polygon, calculated as floor(Person / 100). This resolution (1 dot = 100 people) is chosen because most SA1s have between 200 and 800 people, resulting in 2 to 8 dots per block. Using floor() ensures we only generate whole dots and prevents overcounting.\n\n3\n\nOptionally, to reduce computation time, filter(n_dots &gt; 0) is to skip blocks with zero population.\n\n\n\n\nOutput of this stage should be an sf object with polygons and number of dots for each polygon.\n\nSA1_count_shapefile\n\nSimple feature collection with 14987 features and 3 fields (with 1 geometry empty)\nGeometry type: MULTIPOLYGON\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: 140.9619 ymin: -38.90962 xmax: 149.9762 ymax: -33.98064\nGeodetic CRS:  GCS_GDA2020\n# A tibble: 14,987 × 4\n   SA1_COD     Person n_dots                                            geometry\n   &lt;chr&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;                                  &lt;MULTIPOLYGON [°]&gt;\n 1 20101100101    437      4 (((143.8009 -37.55382, 143.8004 -37.55376, 143.800…\n 2 20101100102    183      1 (((143.7977 -37.55071, 143.7978 -37.55075, 143.798…\n 3 20101100105    382      3 (((143.8156 -37.5587, 143.8169 -37.55885, 143.8175…\n 4 20101100106    584      5 (((143.801 -37.55383, 143.8024 -37.55399, 143.8032…\n 5 20101100107    363      3 (((143.8129 -37.55643, 143.813 -37.5561, 143.8132 …\n 6 20101100108    792      7 (((143.8089 -37.55476, 143.809 -37.55478, 143.8102…\n 7 20101100109    528      5 (((143.8044 -37.55316, 143.8046 -37.55213, 143.804…\n 8 20101100110    512      5 (((143.7886 -37.54654, 143.7882 -37.54637, 143.786…\n 9 20101100111    371      3 (((143.7923 -37.54826, 143.7922 -37.54849, 143.792…\n10 20101100112    424      4 (((143.7918 -37.5514, 143.7917 -37.55106, 143.7916…\n# ℹ 14,977 more rows\n\n\n\n\n2.
