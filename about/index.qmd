## 🇻🇳 Background

![](figures/Ha%20Giang.png){width="95%"}

> I was born and raised in **Northwestern Vietnam** — the mountainous region of quiet beauty and the most kind-hearted people.

### 🎓 Education

**RMIT University** — Melbourne, Australia\
*Master of Statistics & Operations Research*\
*March 2023 – December 2024*

**RMIT University Vietnam** — Hanoi, Vietnam\
*Bachelor of Logistics & Supply Chain Management*\
*October 2017 – May 2022*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 🌏 Work Experience

I began as an **Operations Intern** at **Toyota Vietnam**, working in the warehouse to ensure spare parts arrived on time, in the right place, quantity, and condition. Maybe I’m biased, but Toyota’s low-tech warehouse management system — [`Kanban`](https://www.toyota-global.com/company/history_of_toyota/75years/text/entering_the_automotive_business/chapter1/section4/item4.html)(paper cards) — could manage complex workflows better than any fancy software.

Later, I joined **BSS Group** as a **Manual Software Tester**, writing and executing test plans. As someone new to software development, I was lucky to have incredibly patient and supportive mentors. If I ever get the chance to mentor someone, I’ll strive to be the same.

Both roles were detail-focused and taught me patience. But I craved something more analytical and math-driven — so I pursued a graduate degree in Statistics, right after completing my Business degree.

## 🥰 Some of My Favorite Things

> *I like to do math, to cook, and to code.*\
> (Yes, in that order.)

### 🧠 MATH

I solve math problems in my free time — I’m a nerd, no doubt! The kind of math I study is **statistics** — not pure math, but a mathematical science nonetheless. I feel incredibly grateful to study math at this level. And as cliché as it sounds: `the more I learn, the more I realize how little I actually know.`

![💡 A key result in probability theory underpinning many important statistical applications that deserves more attention](figures/Laws%20of%20Total%20Expectation%20and%20Total%20Variance.gif){width="75%" height="500px" fig-align="center"}

Because AI and machine learning are trending — and statistics is their backbone — here are some resources on *the math of data science* (tested and approved by a nerd 🤓):

#### 📐 Calculus

-   Book: [*Calculus*](https://github.com/taivu312/books/tree/master/mathematics/calculus/stewart_calculus) by James Stewart
-   Course: MIT OpenCourseWare
    -   [Single Variable Calculus](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-01sc-single-variable-calculus-fall-2010/)\
    -   [Multivariable Calculus](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-02sc-multivariable-calculus-fall-2010/)\
-   A fun, intuitive approach: Khan Academy
    -   [Integral Calculus](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/integral-calculus)\
    -   [Differential Calculus](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/differential-calculus)\
    -   [Multivariable Calculus](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/multivariable-calculus)

#### 📊 Linear Algebra

-   Book: [*Linear Algebra with Applications*](https://valpont.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/20151219190836/Linear-Algebra-with-Applications.pdf) by Steven J. Leon
-   Course: [MIT OCW 18.06 Linear Algebra](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-06-linear-algebra-spring-2010/)\
-   Visual & intuitive: [*Math for Game Devs*](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLImQaTpSAdsArRFFj8bIfqMk2X7Vlf3XF) by Freya Holmer — she’s so cute, love her 😍

#### 📈 Mathematical Statistics

I absolutely adore 📘 [*Statistical Inference*](https://pages.stat.wisc.edu/~shao/stat610/Casella_Berger_Statistical_Inference.pdf) by Casella and Berger, and I've set my sights next on 📗 [*Probability and Measure*](https://www.colorado.edu/amath/sites/default/files/attached-files/billingsley.pdf) by Patrick Billingsley.

### 🍜 COOKING

My cooking journey began a long time ago. My parents work incredibly hard to provide for us, and as the oldest sister, I naturally found myself in the kitchen early on.

Things really leveled up when I moved to Australia — I began cooking *exquisite Vietnamese dishes* to share my culture with new friends, soothe my homesickness, and explore cuisines from around the world.

My [inspiration](https://vnexpress.net/doi-song/cooking/thuc-don)? This lovely collection from VnExpress. It’s in Vietnamese, but three things transcend all language barriers — love, music, and yes... food! ❤️🎶🍲

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 💻 CODING

I’m still new to coding — and feel so lucky that auto-completion, Copilot, and ChatGPT were already around when I began.

My favorite language so far is **Java** — it’s declarative, easy to read, and has just the right amount of strictness to catch bugs early. But the language I’m most fluent in is **R**, because I study Statistics — and R was developed *by statisticians, for statisticians* 📈.

Arguing about which programming language is "better" feels a bit pointless to me. Languages are tools, and each serves a different purpose. What matters is what you build with them.

I do wish I’d taken **Data Structures and Algorithms** in school — It's all good, there’s an abundance of amazing online resources now. 📚💻
